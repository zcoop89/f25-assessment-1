// In this section you will answer some work through problems related to the Software Development Lifecycle

//////////////////PROBLEM 1////////////////////
/*
    Reorganize the following steps of the Software Development Lifecycle to be in their correct order.
*/

// Planning
// Analysis of Requirements
// Design
// Implementation
// Testing & Integration
// Maintain


//////////////////PROBLEM 2////////////////////
/*
    Create a variable for each of the above steps of the Software Development Lifecycle and set the values of each variable to a definition of the step.
    The first one is done for you.

const planning = "This is the first step, in which the end goal of the software is determined and defined. Developers typically will see what systems are already in place, and determine what features will need to be added." 
const analysisOfRequirements = "the process of determining user expectations for a new or modified product."
const design = "the process of envisioning and defining software solutions to one or more sets of problems."
const implementation = "the process of adopting and integrating a software application into a business workflow"
const testingAndIntegration = "the phase in software testing in which individual software modules are combined and tested as a group."
const maintain = "Software maintenance in software engineering is the modification of a software product after delivery to correct faults, to improve performance or other attributes."
